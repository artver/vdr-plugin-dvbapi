Basic Installation
==================

 1) Compile the plugin like any other vdr plugin - if you have vdr sources
    then put the sources in the PLUGINS/src/dvbapi subdirectory and type
    'make plugins' in vdr main source directory - the plugin should compile
    and install

 2) Start the VDR with dvbpi plugin, sample command:
 /usr/local/bin/vdr -c /etc/vdr -E /var/vdr -L /usr/local/lib/vdr -P dvbapi

 3) In the oscam.conf file add following options
        [dvbapi]
        enabled = 1
        au = 1
        boxtype = pc
        user = vdr
        pmt_mode = 4
        request_mode = 1

   boxtype to "pc" will allow oscam to take adapter/demux information from CAPMT frame.
   pmt_mode to "4" will allow oscam to use camd.socket in /tmp/ dir
